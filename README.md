# Tic-Tac-Toe
 Console-based version of Tic-Tac-Toe
 
 A simple project to get me back into C++ programming and simple game programming before attempting larger and more complex projects
 
 Some files are only necessary if you open the project in Code::Blocks and can otherwise be ignored
 
 The Tic-Tac-Tac.exe file in the repository is the final compiled version of the game
 It was compiled on a 64bit Windows system and so please recompile the files as instructed below to create an executable that will run on your system

If you are not using Code::Blocks compile main.cpp and include the following classes and necessary files:
    AI (AI.h and AI.cpp)
    Game (Game.h and Game.cpp)
    Grid (Grid.h and Grid.cpp)
    Player (Player.h and Player.cpp)
    
Then run the executable to play the game

Difficulties:
Normal - CPU will choose a square on the grid at random, very easy to beat
Impossible - Plays the optimum strategy for a 3x3 grid, should be unbeatable with the best outcome for the player being a draw

Enjoy a nice simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses)
If you have any questions please let me know
